- added support for select.timeout construct
- added support for lifting-up await in hight-order functions.
ie in simplicified explanation:
```
 for(x <- 1 to n) { s += read(x) }  
```
 is translated to 
```
 1.to(n).foreachAsync { async(s += await(aread(x))) }  
```

- added support for select.fold construct
- scala 2.12
